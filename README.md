# 🎲 Dice Roller

[![Made with HTML, CSS, JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-HTML%2FCSS%2FJS-blue)](https://developer.mozilla.org/)  
A fun and interactive **Dice Roller** web app built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Roll one or multiple dice at once and see the **numbers** and **images** of each dice.

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🎯 Roll **any number of dice** (you choose the amount).  
- 🎲 Displays the **random results** for each dice.  
- 🖼️ Shows **matching dice images** (1–6).  
- 💡 Simple, clean, and responsive design.

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. Enter how many dice you want to roll.  
2. Click the **“Roll the Dice”** button.  
3. JavaScript generates random numbers for each dice:
   ```js
   Math.floor(Math.random() * 6) + 1;
Numbers and corresponding images are displayed dynamically using:

If you want, I can also **make a version that looks extra fancy on GitHub** with **centered title, colors, emojis in the preview, and even live demo badge** — it will make your repo look **professional and eye-catching**.  

Do you want me to do that?
